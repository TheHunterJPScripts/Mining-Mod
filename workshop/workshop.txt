Project Zomboid Mod that add new tables to use for crafting. By itself this mod only add the tiles and the hability to build them in the world. 
Just to clarify, it [b]does not add any new recipe[/b]. Later down the line i will make an other mod that adds some custom recipes but i first want to make a mining mod.
